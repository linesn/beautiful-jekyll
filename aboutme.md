### Scouting communication
I'm currently serving as an assistant scoutmaster in Troop 905 of Eldersburg, Baltimore Area Council. I oversee the new scout (11 year old) patrol. This is my fourth troop I've volunteered in, and I've often thought when getting broken into a new scouting role "I wish I knew someone who had done this before, so I could hear about how they handled it." So, it occured to me that I should probably provide that information for those who come after. I'm not an expert in anything, much less scouting, but I am interested in sharing what is working and not working for me, as an 11 year old scoutmaster in a unit sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

### Disclaimers
I do not represent the BSA or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or anyone else for that matter. My opinions are my own, my mistakes are my fault, and anything I do right is the result of God's kindness, not my own wisdom.

### My Background

I was a cub and scout as a youth. I became an Eagle Scout in 2006, but didn't find an opportunity to serve as an adult leader until 2012. I was blessed with an opportunity to serve as a misionary to teach and give service to the people of Queensland Australia, between 2009 and 2011. More important than anything else, though, I'm a husband and father of a handful of great kids.
