## Why am I writing this?
Six months ago, while watching the General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints, I was thinking about how much there is to learn when you are trying to get up and running in a scout calling. While most BSA troops are staffed by volunteers who have some connection to the program, Mormon troops are often run by people who were assigned to be volunteers, sometimes with little previous experience with scouts. I've tried my hand at a couple of scout positions, and had been a scout as a youth, but there's still so much to learn that it can be daunting. The thought I had during that conference was that I should start a blog sharing what is working and what's not working in my efforts to serve, and maybe just throw in other life experiences and thoughts. I then did what I do best: got distracted for six months. Today, I got the same reminder, so I'm finally starting it up.

## What this is not
This is not an example of how best to do anything. I hope that this blog will be an example of how someone tried to do something, and in some cases I hope I succeed. I've seen so much good that can come from scouting and my church's young men's programs, I'm confident that my unit can do great things for these boys. But I also know it is a bumpy road.

## Where I'm starting:
When I moved to the area at the end of last year, I found the troop had some good things going for it and some unique challenges of its own. We have a good collection of willing leaders, including an experienced scoutmaster and four assistant scoutmasters, a great committee chair, and committed chartered organization leadership. But we also had a mix of interest among the young men in the church, and this meant that the program had struggled to meet Journey to Excellence and National Honor Patrol standards. I got asked to take on jointly leading the 11 year old patrol with another experienced assistant scoutmaster, Chris.

## Where I'm headed:
Chris and I are working on implementing a rotating 4-month framework for patrol meetings and campouts. I've seen this done by other troops, and I'm excited to try it. I'll talk more on that later. We've done out troops first ILST, and that will be it's own discussion too. Right now we are getting ready for our first patrol campout. Stay posted!
